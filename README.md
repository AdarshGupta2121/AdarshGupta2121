👋 Hey, I am Adarsh Gupta

A Computer Science undergraduate at Delhi Technological University with a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms and a growing passion for full-stack web development. I enjoy building scalable, user-centric applications using the MERN stack and solving complex problems through efficient code.

With 800+ DSA problems solved across multiple platforms, I bring a problem-solving mindset to every project—whether it’s designing RESTful APIs, implementing secure authentication, or creating responsive frontend experiences. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and work on real-world projects that create impact.
# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on<br>Building scalable full-stack web applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while improving performance, authentication flows, and clean API design. I’m also actively strengthening my DSA problem-solving skills through competitive platforms.<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>Full-stack MERN projects, open-source React applications, or backend systems involving REST APIs, authentication, and database design. Open to collaborating with developers who focus on clean code and real-world use cases.<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with<br>System design basics, scalable backend architecture, and writing production-grade code (testing, optimization, and best practices) for full-stack applications.<br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>Advanced React patterns, Redux, backend optimization, and core CS fundamentals including DBMS, OS, and Computer Networks—alongside continuous practice of DSA.<br>💬 Ask me about<br>React, MERN stack development, REST APIs, JWT authentication, Tailwind CSS, or DSA strategies using C++.<br>⚡ Fun fact<br>I’ve solved 800+ DSA problems and still enjoy debugging frontend UI issues just as much as cracking algorithmic challenges 😄
